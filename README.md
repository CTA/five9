# Five9

This RubyGem is a ruby integration for the five9 API. Currently, it is only partly integrated with the statistics API. The end goal is to have a full integration.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'five9'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install five9

## Usage

In order to use this you will have to have an active account with [five9](www.five9.com).
	
	agent_stats = Five9::AgentStats.new("exampleuser","examplepassword")
	agent_stats.setSessionParams(session={rolling_period: "Today", shift_start: 25200000, statistics_range: "CurrentDay", time_zone: -21600000}) //the numbers are in milliseconds.
	stats = a.getStatistics(["Total Calls","Avg Handle Time"])//leave empty to return all stats.
	updated_stats = a.getStatisticsUpdate
